In a study, researchers found that athletes who listened to music after strong physical exertion showed more voluntary physical activity, a greater decrease in blood lactate concentration as well as greater decrease in perceived exertion than athletes who recovered without listening to music.
LeBron James is a great example of this. Possibly the greatest basketball player of all time and he listens to music before every game.
