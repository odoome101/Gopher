Here are some of the most famous opening lines to lyrics:

This beat is automatic, supersonic, hypnotic, funky fresh.

Do you remember, the 21st night of September?

Dearly beloved, we have gathered here today to get through this thing called life.

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?

Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me, I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.

A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly and is also known as a busta.

When I was a young boy my father took me into the city to see a marching band.

If I should stay, I would only be in your way.

Listen up, y'all, 'cause this is it, the beat that I'm bangin' is de-li-cious.
