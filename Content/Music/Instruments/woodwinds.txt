Many instruments are in the woodwind family, but the six major ones are flutes and piccolos, saxophones, clarinets, oboes, bassoons, and english horns.

Woodwind instruments are incredibly popular with beginner and professional players as well as hobbyists. Many young band students start their musical careers on a woodwind instrument and will go on to play several within the family. You can hear woodwind instruments featured in all types of music, from classical and orchestral pieces to jazz to blues to rock & roll and nearly everything in between.
